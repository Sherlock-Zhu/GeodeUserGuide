您使用`gemfire.properties`设置加入集群并配置系统成员行为。 集群成员包括应用程序，缓存服务器，定位器和其他Geode进程。

您可以将`gemfire.properties`中任何与安全相关的（以`security- *`开头的属性）配置属性放入单独的`gfsecurity.properties`文件中。 将这些配置设置放在单独的文件中可以限制对安全配置数据的访问。 这样，您仍然可以允许对`gemfire.properties`文件进行读写访问。

您还可以在`gfsecurity.properties`中定义特定于提供程序的属性（“ssl”属性），而不是在命令行或环境中定义它们。

您可以使用Unicode转义序列在属性文件中指定非ASCII文本。 有关详细信息，请参阅[在Apache Geode属性文件中使用非ASCII字符串](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/17/reference/topics/non-ascii_strings_in_config_files.html)。

**注意:** 除非另有说明，否则这些设置仅影响此集群中的活动 - 不是客户端和服务器之间的活动，也不是多站点安装中的网关发送者和网关接收者之间的活动。

| bind-address                                         | Relevant only for multi-homed hosts - machines with multiple network interface cards. Specifies the adapter card the cache binds to for peer-to-peer communication. Also specifies the default location for Geode servers to listen on, which is used unless overridden by the `server-bind-address`. An empty string causes the member to listen on the default card for the machine. This is a machine-wide attribute used for system member and client/server communication. It has no effect on locator location, unless the locator is embedded in a member process.<br/>Specify the IP address, not the hostname, because each network card may not have a unique hostname. An empty string (the default) causes the member to listen on the default card for the machine. | S, L                            | *not set*                                                    |

| cluster-configuration-dir                            | This property specifies the directory in which the cluster configuration related disk-store and artifacts are stored. This property is only applicable to dedicated locators that have “enable-cluster-configuration” set to true. | L                               | *not set*                                                    |
| conflate-events                                      | Used only by clients in a client/server installation. This is a client-side property that is passed to the server. Affects subscription queue conflation in this client’s servers. Specifies whether to conflate (true setting), not conflate (false), or to use the server’s conflation setting (server). | S                               | server                                                       |
| conserve-sockets                                     | Specifies whether sockets are shared by the system member’s threads. If true, threads share, and a minimum number of sockets are used to connect to the cluster. If false, every application thread has its own sockets for distribution purposes. You can override this setting for individual threads inside your application. Where possible, it is better to set conserve-sockets to true and enable the use of specific extra sockets in the application code if needed. WAN deployments increase the messaging demands on a Geode system. To avoid hangs related to WAN messaging, always set `conserve-sockets=false` for Geode members that participate in a WAN deployment. | S, L                            | true                                                         |
| delta-propagation                                    | Specifies whether to distribute the deltas for entry updates, instead of the full values, between clients and servers and between peers. | S                               | true                                                         |
| deploy-working-dir                                   | Working directory used when deploying JAR application files to cluster members. This directory can be local and unique to the member or a shared resource. See [Deploying Application JARs to Apache Geode Members](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/17/configuring/cluster_config/deploying_application_jars.html) for more information. | S                               | .

| disable-auto-reconnect                               | By default, a Geode member (both locators and servers) will attempt to reconnect and reinitialize the cache after it has been forced out of the cluster by a network partition event or has otherwise been shunned by other members. Use this property to turn off the autoreconnect behavior. See [Handling Forced Cache Disconnection Using Autoreconnect](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/17/managing/member-reconnect.html) for more details. | S, L                            | false                                                        |
| disable-tcp                                          | Boolean indicating whether to disable the use of TCP/IP sockets for inter-cache point-to-point messaging. If disabled, the cache uses datagram (UDP) sockets. | S, L                            | false                                                        |
| distributed-system-id                                | Identifier used to distinguish messages from different clusters. This is required for Portable Data eXchange (PDX) data serialization. Set `distributed-system-id`to different values for different systems in a multi-site (WAN) configuration, and to different values for production vs. development environments. This setting must be the same for every member of a given cluster and unique to each cluster within a WAN installation.  Valid values are integers in the range -1…255. -1 means no setting. | S, L                            | -1                                                           |
| durable-client-id                                    | Used only for clients in a client/server installation. If set, this indicates that the client is durable and identifies the client. The ID is used by servers to reestablish any messaging that was interrupted by client downtime. | C                               | *not set*                                                    |
| durable-client-timeout                               | Used only for clients in a client/server installation. Number of seconds this client can remain disconnected from its server and have the server continue to accumulate durable events for it. | C                               | 300                                                          |
| enable-network-partition-detection                   | Boolean instructing the system to detect and handle splits in the cluster, typically caused by a partitioning of the network (split brain) where the cluster is running. You must set this property to the same value across all your cluster members. In addition, this property must be set to `true` if you are using persistent regions and configure your regions to use DISTRIBUTED_ACK or GLOBAL scope to avoid potential data conflicts. | S, L                            | true                                                         |
| enable-cluster-configuration                         | A value of “true” causes the creation of cluster configuration on dedicated locators. The cluster configuration service on dedicated locator(s) with this property set to “true” would serve the configuration to new members joining the cluster and also save the configuration changes caused by the `gfsh` commands. This property is only applicable to dedicated locators.. | L                               | true                                                         |
| enable-time-statistics                               | Boolean instructing the system to track time-based statistics for the cluster and caching. Disabled by default for performance reasons and not recommended for production environments. You must also configure `statistics-sampling-enabled`to true and specify a `statistics-archive-file`. | S, L                            | false                                                        |
| enforce-unique-host                                  | Whether partitioned regions will put redundant copies of the same data in different members running on the same physical machine. By default, Geode tries to put redundant copies on different machines, but it will put them on the same machine if no other machines are available. Setting this property to true prevents this and requires different machines for redundant copies. | S                               | false                                                        |
| geode.disallow-internal-messages-without-credentials | A boolean that enables internal message validation when true. Set this system property to true on the `gfsh start server` command line when restarting servers to work with upgraded clients. | S                               | false                                                        |
| groups                                               | Defines the list of groups that this member belongs to. Use commas to separate group names. Note that anything defined by the roles gemfire property will also be considered a group. See [Using Member Groups](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/17/configuring/cluster_config/using_member_groups.html) for more information. | S                               | *not set*                                                    |
| http-service-bind-address                            | If set, then the Geode member binds the embedded HTTP service to the specified address. If this property is not set but the HTTP service is enabled using `http-service-port`, then Geode binds the HTTP service to the member’s local address. Used by the Geode Pulse Web application and the developer REST API service. | S                               | *not set*                                                    |
| http-service-port                                    | If non-zero, then Geode starts an embedded HTTP service that listens on this port. The HTTP service is used to host the Geode Pulse Web application and the development REST API service. If you are hosting the Pulse web app on your own Web server and are not using the development REST API service, then disable this embedded HTTP service by setting this property to zero. Ignored if `jmx-manager` and `start-dev-rest-api` are both set to false. | S                               | 7070                                                         |
| jmx-manager                                          | If true then this member is willing to be a JMX Manager. All the other JMX Manager properties will be used when it does become a manager. If this property is false then all other `jmx-manager-*` properties are ignored. | S, L                            | false (except on locators)                                   |
| jmx-manager-bind-address                             | By default the jmx-manager (when configured with a port) will listen on all the local host’s addresses. You can use this property to configure what IP address or host name the JMX Manager will listen on for non-HTTP connections. Ignored if JMX Manager is false or `jmx-manager-port` is zero. | S, L                            | *not set*                                                    |
| jmx-manager-hostname-for-clients                     | Lets you control what hostname will be given to clients that ask the locator for the location of a JMX Manager. By default the IP address that the jmx-manager reports is used. But for clients on a different network this property allows you to configure a different hostname that will be given to clients. Ignored if `jmx-manager` is false or `jmx-manager-port` is zero. | S, L                            | *not set*                                                    |
| jmx-manager-http-port                                | *Deprecated.* Use `http-service-port` instead.               | S, L                            | 7070                                                         |
| jmx-manager-port                                     | The port this JMX Manager will listen to for client connections. If this property is set to zero then Geode will not allow remote client connections but you can alternatively use the standard system properties supported by the JVM for configuring access from remote JMX clients. Ignored if `jmx-manager` is false. | S, L                            | 1099                                                         |
| jmx-manager-start                                    | If true then this member will start a jmx manager when it creates a cache. Management tools like gfsh can be configured to connect to the jmx-manager. In most cases you should not set this because a jmx manager will automatically be started when needed on a member that sets “jmx-manager” to true. Ignored if jmx-manager is false. | S, L                            | false                                                        |
| jmx-manager-update-rate                              | The rate, in milliseconds, at which this member will push updates to any JMX Managers. Currently this value should be greater than or equal to the statistic-sample-rate. Setting this value too high will cause stale values to be seen by gfsh and Geode Pulse. | S, L                            | 2000                                                         |
| load-cluster-configuration-from-dir                  | Setting this property to “true” causes loading of cluster configuration from “cluster_config” directory in the locator. This property is only applicable to dedicated locators that have “enable-cluster-configuration” set to true. | L                               | false                                                        |
| locator-wait-time                                    | The number of seconds that a member should wait for a locator to start if a locator is not available when attempting to join the cluster. Use this setting when you are starting locators and peers all at once. This timeout allows peers to wait for the locators to finish starting up before attempting to join the cluster. | S                               | 0                                                            |
| locators                                             | The list of locators used by system members. The list must be configured consistently for every member of the cluster. If the list is empty, locators are not used.For each locator, provide a host name and/or address (separated by ‘@’, if you use both), followed by a port number in brackets. Examples:`locators=address1[port1],address2[port2] ``locators=hostName1@address1[port1],hostName2@address2[port2] ``locators=hostName1[port1],hostName2[port2]`<br/><br/>**Note:**  On multi-homed hosts, this last notation will use the default address.

| member-timeout                                       | Geode uses the `member-timeout` server configuration, specified in milliseconds, to detect the abnormal termination of members. The configuration setting is used in two ways: 1) First it is used during the UDP heartbeat detection process. When a member detects that a heartbeat datagram is missing from the member that it is monitoring after the time interval of 2 * the value of `member-timeout`, the detecting member attempts to form a TCP/IP stream-socket connection with the monitored member as described in the next case. 2) The property is then used again during the TCP/IP stream-socket connection. If the suspected process does not respond to the *are you alive* datagram within the time period specified in `member-timeout`, the membership coordinator sends out a new membership view that notes the member’s failure.<br/><br/>Valid values are in the range 1000..600000. | S, L                            | 5000                                                         |
| membership-port-range                                | The range of ports available for unicast UDP messaging and for TCP failure detection. This is specified as two integers separated by a hyphen. Different members can use different ranges.<br/><br/>Geode randomly chooses at least two unique integers from this range for the member, one for UDP unicast messaging and the other for TCP failure detection messaging. If tcp-port is configured to 0, it will also randomly select a port from this range for TCP sockets used for peer-to-peer communication only.<br/><br/>Therefore, the specified range must include at least three available port numbers (UDP, FD_SOCK, and TCP DirectChannel).<br/><br/>The system uniquely identifies the member using the combined host IP address and UDP port number.<br/><br/>You may want to restrict the range of ports that Geode uses so the product can run in an environment where routers only allow traffic on certain ports. | S, L                            | 1024-65535                                                   |

- **Using Non-ASCII Strings in Apache Geode Property Files**

  You can specify Unicode (non-ASCII) characters in Apache Geode property files by using a `\uXXXX` escape sequence.



### Using Non-ASCII Strings in Apache Geode Property Files 
You can specify Unicode (non-ASCII) characters in Apache Geode property files by using a `\uXXXX`escape sequence.

For a supplementary character, you need two escape sequences, one for each of the two UTF-16 code units. The XXXX denotes the 4 hexadecimal digits for the value of the UTF-16 code unit. For example, a properties file might have the following entries:

```
s1=hello there
s2=\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f
```

For example, in `gemfire.properties`, you might write:

```
log-file=my\u00df.log
```

to indicate the desired propery definition of `log-file=myß.log`.

If you have edited and saved the file in a non-ASCII encoding, you can convert it to ASCII with the `native2ascii` tool included in your Oracle Java distribution. For example, you might want to do this when editing a properties file in Shift_JIS, a popular Japanese encoding.
